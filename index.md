# Blue Stamp Engineering Third Eye for The Blind

Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

# First Milestone: Breadboard Prototype
I will build my project using the prototype I currently have on a breadboard. I will want to customize it more and add features that will help the user even more. Then once I finish and finalize that I will put all of this on a perf board and solder it on. After I finish that I will find a comfortable way for the user to wear it.

There are 7 different parts. A slide switch, LED, 200 ohms resistor, ultrasonic sensor, Arduino nano, buzzer, and DC 3V vibration motor. A slide switch is a switch that slides between 2 settings and I use it to switch between the buzzer and the motor. A LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when current flows through it and is used to indicate if the circuit is working. A 200 ohms resistor is a  resistor that limits the flow of electrons through a circuit to around 200 ohms. An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Then those signals are used to turn on either the buzzer or the motor. An Arduino Nano is kinda like the brain of the whole thing. It is a microcontroller that reads inputs and gives outputs. A buzzer is an audio signaler device that is used to indicate to the user that something is close by. A DC 3V vibration motor is a small motor that vibrates when something is close by.

Some technical progress I have made so far was designing on the breadboard, completing the breadboard, putting the code in, testing if it works, and completing my first milestone.

Some challenges for future milestones are that I need to find out what customizations I need to implement, the parts needed to do that, how to implement that onto a perf board, and find a way to put the perf board on something that is easy to wear. One thing I'm not sure it will be a challenge or not will possibly be Bluetooth.

My basic plan is to add some features to the current circuit, put that onto a perf board, find a comfortable mount for the perf board, and find a good place to keep it

# Starter Project: Art Deco Mini Cat Lamp
I had 5 different parts. The transistor, resistor, LED, photoresistor, a switch, and the battery 
For those who don't know, a transistor is a mini semiconductor that is used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power.  is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit. A photoresistor is a sensor that changes its resistance when light shines on it.

What I most enjoyed about this project is definitely soldering everything together. I enjoy soldering a lot.  It also helps teach my hand to be very steady and precise. There is one part I struggled with is desoldering the photoresistor because as you can see it is a bit twisted and high. I wasn't able to desolder it correctly so I had to resolve it and bend it up. It doesn't affect the performance of the project only the look

Then my next step is to start on my intermediate project which is the Third Eye for the Blind

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
